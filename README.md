## Technology Stack

**Data Sources :** CSV, Excel, PDF  
**Tools :** Excel, PowerBI, Power Query, DAX  

## Steps and Workflow

1. **Data Extraction**

Imported the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** Dataset from Kaggle in **CSV** format. This HR Dataset contains information about 1470 employees, such as their age, gender, department, job role, salary, education, performance, satisfaction, attrition, etc.  
Then, coverted it into an **Excel** format in order to perform the process of Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.  
Next, updated the headers of all the columns. Then, applied filters on all the columns and checked for any outliers or anomalies in the data set and decided whether to keep them or remove them. Removed the duplicate or null values from the dataset. Also, Modified the text entries in some columns using Find and Replace Methods to make them easy to understand.
Added two additional columns **Age Groups** and **Salary Slab** next to Columns **Age** and **Monthly Income** respectively for performing data analysis and visualization steps in power BI.

2. **Data Integration**

Imported the dataset from my system into **Power BI** in Excel format.

3. **Data Transformation**

After importing the dataset, used the Power Query Editor to perform any further data cleaning, transformation or validation that was needed for report building such as checked the datatypes of each of the columns and updated them as per the column values.  
Also created few more additional columns such as **Attrition Count** for dashboard creation. Finally, clicked on **Close and Apply** button in Power Query Editor and my dataset was ready for Dashboard Preparation.

4. **Defining the KPIs and Advanced DAX Calculations**

**KPIs** and **DAX Measures** are the core elements that drive the dashboard and display the data in a meaningful and actionable way. KPIs and DAX measures should be relevant, accurate and simple and should match the business requirement and the audienceâ€™s needs and expectations.   
Created dynamic DAX Measures for KPIs such as **Attrition Rate**, **Average Age**, **Employee Count**, **Monthly Salary**, etc.

5 . **Dashboard Design**

A dashboard layout and visualizations are the visual elements that make up the dashboard and display the data attractively and understandably.  
**Created KPIs using Cards** : Count of Employees, Attrition, Attrition Rate, Average Age, Average Salary, Average Years  
**Created Slicers** : Department, Education Field, Age Groups, Salary Slab, Gender  
**Created Visuals** :
